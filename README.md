### Linux // Debian

- [My Debian Setup](https://github.com/hoodieblanket/learningJourney/blob/master/Lets%20Learn%20Linux/Debian%20Setup.md)

This document is just my own collection of typical processes, learnings and mapping my working structure to make it more efficient as I am primarily a windows guys so I need to record and keep references for the linux/debian side. It has helpful shortcuts, tools and general operations to make life easier.
