#  learning_journey

As I am going through the journey from scratch, it reflects my interests over time.

It lets me put things into my own words and have my learning organised.

## Python
   * [for loop](https://github.com/hoodieblanket/learningJourney/blob/master/topics/For%20Loops)

```python
for char in range(5):
  print("test")
```
